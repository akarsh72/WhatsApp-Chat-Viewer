# 📲 Your Chat, Your Way
## 🛠️ The Problem
---
When exporting WhatsApp chats, the resulting text file can often be overwhelming and difficult to navigate. The messages lose their original structure, making it time-consuming to read and analyze conversations. Once exported, it becomes nearly impossible to restore the chat’s readability, negatively impacting the user experience.

If you haven’t exported your WhatsApp chats before, follow these steps:
1. Open a **WhatsApp chat**.
2. Tap on the **three dots** in the top right corner.
3. Select **More**.
4. Choose **Export Chat**.

Once you export the file, you'll quickly notice how difficult it is to interpret the raw format.
